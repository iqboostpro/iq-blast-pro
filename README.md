**What Is IQ Blast Pro?**
-------------------------

IQ Blast Pro is a natural dietary supplement created to help boost brain health and function. The supplement contains 8 potent ingredients that work together to address the underlying cause of memory loss and other brain problems which is leaky brain syndrome.

In addition to boosting brain health, the formula reduces stress and anxiety, relaxes the mind, and enhances mood. According to the manufacturer, the IQ Blast Pro capsule will provide positive results to all people. The IQ Blast Pro formula is available in capsule form and every bottle contains 60 capsules.

This supplement is made in strict and sterile conditions in lab facilities that follow GMP guidelines and are approved by the FDA. It is free from GMOs, habit-forming substances, and other toxins. IQ BLast Pro capsule is also vegan-friendly.

**How Does IQ Blast Pro Work?**
-------------------------------

IQ Blast Pro works by enhancing the neurotransmitter activity in the brain, improving brain cell communication, and promoting better blood flow to the brain. This results in improved cognitive performance, memory retention, and mental clarity.

The supplement’s carefully selected ingredients act as nootropics, stimulating the production of key neurotransmitters like dopamine and acetylcholine, which are essential for focus, motivation, and memory. Additionally, IQ Blast Pro boosts brain energy levels by ensuring optimal oxygen and nutrient delivery to brain cells, helping them function more effectively.

Many of the ingredients in IQ Blast Pro also precisely target “neurotoxins,” which are toxic particles impacting your brain. Your body and brain are bombarded by these toxic particles every day. These neurotoxins cause cognitive decline and forgetfulness, weakening your brain from the inside out.

**IQ Blast Pro Ingredients**
----------------------------

IQ Blast Pro contains plant-based ingredients linked to cognition, memory, and overall brain health.

Dr. Dickinson told Michael about a specific list of herbs and plants that could help reverse Linda’s memory loss. He had seen many of these ingredients work in Tibetan monks, who drank a special tea with many of these ingredients daily.

Here are all of the ingredients in IQ Blast Pro and how they work, according to the manufacturer:

**Ajwain**: Ajwain is one of the ingredients in IQ Blast Pro that traces its roots to Tibetan monks. Dr. Dickinson, co-creator of IQ Blast Pro, claims he observed monks drinking a special tea with ajwain and other nutrients daily. He checked the monks’ brain scans and found the tea was working to support memory and cognition – even well into their 80s. Ajwain is ajowan, thymol seeds, or bishop’s weed. It grows naturally in dry, arid regions of northern Africa, India, Iran, and Afghanistan.

**Choline**: Choline is a nutrient naturally present in eggs and many other foods. It’s a precursor to acetylcholine, a memory formation and recall neurotransmitter. Choline “acts like a builder and a cleaner for the blood-brain barrier,” according to the official IQ Blast Pro, helping to repair the barrier and keep it intact.

**Evening Primrose**: Evening primrose can stimulate the production of CLA and GLA, which are key players in neuroplasticity or your brain’s natural ability to adapt. Numerous studies show how vital neuroplasticity is for brain health and healthy aging.

**Turmeric**: IQ Blast Pro claims to use a particular turmeric that only grows in the Himalayan Mountains. That type of turmeric has a greater concentration of curcuminoids than ordinary turmeric. It’s known for “erasing senior moments and helping you recall names, passwords, and tiny details,” according to the official IQ Blast Pro. It can also help neutralize inflammation in and around the brain, “improving and reversing memory loss” even in people with “mild and severe cognitive impairment.”

**Vitamin B6**: Vitamin B6 “produces neurotransmitters like serotonin and norepinephrine” linked to sleep, mood, and memory, among other areas. You could have an increased risk of cognitive dysfunction if deficient in vitamin B6 and other B vitamins.

**Inositol**: Inositol “promotes calmness and reduces anxiety,” according to Dr. Dickinson. Chemically, inositol is a sugar your body creates and is found in certain foods. Many people take inositol as a supplement for its purported effects on cognition and mood.

**Vitamin C:** Vitamin C is one of the best antioxidants in the natural world. Fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamin C. Some take vitamin C supplements daily for health and wellness.  
MCT: Medium chain triglycerides are one of the best energy sources for your body and brain. Your brain uses more energy than any other part of your body, and MCTs can help give your brain the fuel it needs to perform at its best.

**Spirulina**: Spirulina is an antioxidant-rich seaweed that has been popular in traditional medicine for centuries. Some people take spirulina daily for brain health, physical energy, and overall health and wellness.

Michael Adams and Dr. Dickinson state IQ Blast Pro is 100% vegan and non-GMO. The formula does not contain genetically modified or animal-based ingredients. It is all-natural, plant-based, and assembled in the United States.
